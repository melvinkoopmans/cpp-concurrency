# C++ Concurrency

The aim of this project is to learn how to write multithreaded applications in C++, focusing on:

* Sharing data between threads
* Synchronizing concurrent operations
* The C++ memory model
* Lock-based and lock-free concurrent data structures
* Thread management, thread pools
* Parallel algorithms
* Testing & debugging of multithreaded application
